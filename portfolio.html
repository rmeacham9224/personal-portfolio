                <p>Hello, my name is Ryan Meacham! I am currently pursuing my PharmD/MHIIM through the University of Tennessee College of Pharmacy with plans to complete my education in 2023. I was born in Nashville and have recently come home to finish the final three years of the pharmacy curriculum. I was employed by Publix Pharmacy in 2017, where I began as a pharmacy technician and eventually would reach intern status upon entering Pharmacy school. Following graduation, I plan on pursuing a residency with a focus in Oncology or Infectious Diseases, however this is subject to change as I explore more options within the field. I also have a strong desire to utilize available data to improve clinical outcomes which has led me to pursue my MHIIM as well as attend coding bootcamp through Vanderbilt University. I am hoping to apply the knowledge I gain through my dual degree program alongside the skills I am developing in coding bootcamp to best serve my future patients. </p>

                <p>In my off time, I enjoy playing golf, watching basketball and embrace any chance I have to listen to or find new music. Being from Nashville, I feel as though music is a huge part of me and you can often find me mercilessly dancing in the crowd at concerts. I have a strong tie to the Tennessee Titans and Vanderbilt sports, but I also tend to pull for Auburn University (my alma mater) as well as the University of Tennessee when they are not playing Vandy. I currently live with the love of my life, Ruby, who is truly a super mutt. People are my passion, so feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would just like to say hi!</p>
